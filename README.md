# GUICode
11/26 - Added two textveiws instead of one. The idea is that the bottom is going to be a status indicator for the time being. Im not sure why it doesnt update immediately. I am also aware that if you exit the application and then restart it the program will throw errors and I am currently looking into this. Otherwise the applicaton should be functioning as desired.
